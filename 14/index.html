			// start with strings, numbers and booleans
			let age = 100;
			let age2 = age;
			age = 200;
			// age 2 keeps its initial value of 100
			// same principal for strings

			// Let's say we have an array
			const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

			// and we want to make a copy of it.
			const team = players;

			// You might think we can just do something like this:
			// team[3] = 'Bill'

			// however what happens when we update that array?
			/**
			 *?  both values are changed - players[] & team[]
			 *?  array variable names are just references to the array itself, so
			 *?  updating one reference, effectively updates all references as
			 *?  they point to the same thing
			 */

			// now here is the problem!
			// oh no - we have edited the original array too!
			// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
			// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

			// one way
			const team2 = players.slice();

			// or create a new array and concat the old one in
			const team3 = [].concat(players);

			// or use the new ES6 Spread
			const team4 = [...players];

			// or
			const team5 = Array.from(players);

			// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

			// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

			// with Objects
			const person = {
				name: "Wes Bos",
				age: 80
			};

			// and think we make a copy:
			const captain = person;
			captain.number = 99;
			/**
			 *?  as with arrays, both values are changed as the variable
			 *?  name is just a reference to the object itself.
			 *?  person.number and captain.number are now both 99
			 */

			// how do we take a copy instead?
			const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });

			// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread.
			// confirmed works
			const cap5 = { ...person };

			// Things to note - Object.assign is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
			// lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

			const dev = {
				name: "ian",
				age: 4,
				social: {
					twitter: "@ian",
					facebook: "ian.dev"
				}
			};

            console.log(dev);
            
            const newDev = Object.assign({}, dev);
            newDev.age = 22
            newDev.social.twitter = '@aristotle'
            console.log(newDev);

            // Doing this, the age values are different for each object,
            // but the twitter value is changed for BOTH objects.
            // It is still otherwise linked to the old object on some level

            // Quick & dirty way to clone an object on all levels is to
            // convert the object to a string (so all 1 level), then parse
            // back into JSON and store as a new object variable

            const evenNewerDev = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(dev))
            evenNewerDev.social.twitter = '@plato'
            console.log({dev});
            console.log({evenNewerDev});

            // even
